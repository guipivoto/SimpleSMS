# SimpleSMS
Very simple SMS Reader app which add some custom actions to the notifications allowing user to delete and block and SMS directly from the Notification

## About it
Some SMS apps does not have a "delete" option on the SMS notification. This way, I can not delete newly received SMS from my Smartwatch (Samsung Galaxy Watch). Thus, I decided to create this very base SMS Reader which just have a Inbox and display the proper notification when a new SMS arrived (including a delete option).

I made this app sometime ago and now, I'm rebuilding it. I'm doing this so I can learn and improve my skills with Kotlin, Compose, Navigation etc

During some time, this app will feature both Java and Kotlin code as I'm migrating every class and screen.

This way, this is more a learning project than an app itself.

##What IÂ´m learning with this project
- Jetpack Compose
- Navigation Compose
- Dependency Injection (Dagger/Hilt)
- Clean Architecture (View, ViewModel, Repository)
- Kotlin
- Flow
